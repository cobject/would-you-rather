# Project: Would you rather?

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, I made a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.. Backend data is from [Would you rather starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter).

# Objectives

1. State management using redux
2. Routing views
3. Meet functionality

# Installation

1. install package
   `$npm install`

2. start application
   `$npm start`

# Checklist

## LogIn Flow

- [x] Does the application have a way to log in and log out?
- [x] Does the application work correctly regardless of which person the user impersonates?

## Application Functionality

- [x] Does the application interact with the backend correctly?
- [x] Does the code run without errors? Is the code free of warnings that resulted from not following the best practices listed in the documentation, such as using key for list items? Is the code formatted properly? 

## Architecture

- [x] Does the store serve as the application’s single source of truth?
- [x] Is application state managed by Redux?
- [x] Does application state update correctly?
- [x] Does the architecture of the application make sense?
